Some of the steps to ask yourself if event bubbling can be used or not:

Identify the Target Elements

1.Are the elements I want to handle events for part of a group with a common ancestor ?

If yes, you can likely use event bubbling.

Eg: A list of items (```html<ul><li>...</li></ul>```), buttons in a form, or dynamically added rows in a table.

If no, event bubbling may not be suitable unless the events naturally propagate to a meaningful ancestor.

Assess if the Target Elements Are Dynamic

2.Will new elements be added or removed dynamically?

If yes, event bubbling is highly recommended because adding individual event listeners for dynamic elements can lead to inefficiency.

Eg: A dynamically updating chat app where new messages are added to a list.

3.Check for Common Event Types

Are the events being triggered consistently across multiple elements of the same type?
If yes, you can often handle these events with bubbling.

Eg: Clicking multiple buttons, hovering over menu items, or focusing on form inputs.


Some of the practical use cases where event bubbling can be used with examples:

Delegating Event Handlers:

1.Problem: You have a dynamic list of items, and you need to handle click events for each item. Adding event listeners to each item individually can lead to performance issues, especially if the list is large or updated frequently.

Solution: Use event delegation by attaching a single event listener to a common ancestor. Let the event bubble up and handle it at the ancestor level, checking the event target.

```javascript

const list = document.querySelector('#itemList');

list.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    if (event.target && event.target.matches('li')) {
    console.log('Item clicked:', event.target.textContent);
    }
}); 
```

Capturing Events for Nested Components

2.Problem: In a UI with nested components, such as a modal with buttons, you want to handle events like closing the modal when clicking outside of it.

Solution: Attach the event listener to a higher-level ancestor (like document) and use bubbling to determine if the click originated outside the modal.

```javascript

document.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    const modal = document.querySelector('#modal');
    if (modal && !modal.contains(event.target)) {
    modal.style.display = 'none';
    }
}); 

```

Handling Form Submissions

3.Problem: You have multiple forms or inputs in a single container, and you want to validate or process submissions dynamically.

Solution: Add a listener to the container and use bubbling to handle specific form submissions.

```javascript

const formContainer = document.querySelector('#forms');

formContainer.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    if (event.target && event.target.tagName === 'FORM') {
    console.log('Form submitted:', event.target.id);
    // Process the form data
    }
}); 
```
