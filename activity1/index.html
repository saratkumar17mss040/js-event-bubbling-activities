<!-- 1. User understands the concept of event bubbling and how events propagate in the DOM -->

<!-- 
 Activity: create a button to open a modal - open modal, and a simple modal with overlay which is initially not displayed.
 and create another button within the modal - button inside modal.
 add click event listeners for open modal button, button inside modal, overlay and modal - wrapper (div), body element and with callback functions logging which are clicked
 and make sure to toggle overlay display when opening the modal to show and when clicked on overlay it should hide the modal.
 make use of style.diplay property for it.

 Note: Please make use of event bubbling nature to close the modal when button inside modal and modal content is clicked as well.
 
 Hint: Event bubbling should be taken care in the parent element.

 Subactivity 1.1: click on open modal button and observe the sequence in which the logs are printed.
 Subactivity 1.2: click on button inside modal and observe the sequence in which the logs are printed.
 Subactivity 1.3: click on overlay wrapper after opening the modal and observe the sequence in which the logs are printed.
 Subactivity 1.4: click on modal content and observe the sequence in which the logs are printed.

 Note: 
 
 Please refer the modal-closed and modal-opened images to see how it needs to be built for
 more clartiy on UI. Please open the image with chrome browser.

 Please make sure to clear your console logs after each click, to see the proper sequence and not get confused
