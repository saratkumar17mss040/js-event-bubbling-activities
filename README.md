**JS Event bubbling activity:**

Note: I think adding it in table would make it difficult to read and check and evaluate.
so i have created separate markdown files for each activity in its own folder for much better clarity.
The topic that i took generally needs more explanation on activity. I have tried my best to keep it concise, to the point and also not leave important points.

I have updated the order that i feel would be better, also included sub activity:

Activity 1: [link](activity1/activity1.md)

Activity 2: [link](activity2/activity2.md)

Activity 34: [link](activity34/activity34.md)

Activity 5: [link](activity5/activity5.md)

Some of the tools and references that i have used are:

mdn
javascript info
windows native snip & sketch for basic highlighting on UI
